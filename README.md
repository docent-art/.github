# Shared Templates

This repository contains shared templates for [Docent](https://github.com/docent-art)'s GitHub projects. 

The repository is **public**, as required by GitHub, to apply templates and configurations across all repositories within the organization.

## Contents

- **Pull Request Template**: A template to guide contributors when submitting changes. The default PR template is located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. When a user creates a new pull request in any Docent repository, this template is automatically populated in the PR description field, ensuring that all necessary information is included.

## Usage

These templates are automatically available in all repositories within our organization. If a repository requires a different template, simply create a `.github` folder in that repository and add a new `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file. This custom template will take precedence over the global template for that specific repository.

## Contributing

To suggest changes, please submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
